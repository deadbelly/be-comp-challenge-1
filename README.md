# be-comp-challenge-1
This was an exercise in which I attempted to match a comp as closely as possible with some creative freedom (ability to use own assets etc). There are a few small innaccuracies (mostly with color matching) that I may go back to correct. The site is responsive, runs well on mobile, and was tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. It is deployed to GitHub Pages [here](https://deadbelly.github.io/be-comp-challenge-1/).

## The comp I was assigned:
